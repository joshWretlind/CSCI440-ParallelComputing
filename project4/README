In order to compile, run make. Note: uses C++11 standards(Sayers and Alamode's compilers work just fine for this)
./run will run the  code for all of the J and P values we need

format of command:

-np option forms the P value we need to run with
Pass the J value we're calculating as the first argument to ./main_exe

ex:

mpiexec -np 4 ./main_exe 2
This will run the code with J=2, P=4

The i_min, i_max, j_min, j_max assume that the first index of the array is 0

i refers to which row the value is in
j refers to which column the value is in

In order to compile, run make. Note: uses C++11 standards
./RunJ2P4 will run the code with J=2 and P=4
./run will run the  code for all of the J and P values we need

format of command:

-np option forms the P value we need to run with
Pass the J value we're calculating as the first argument to ./main_exe
ex:

mpiexec -np 4 ./main_exe 2
This will run the code with J=2, P=4
